# XPostsFinder – Smarter Conversations on X (Twitter)

Endless scrolling on X can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. XPostsFinder helps you cut through the noise by automatically surfacing the conversations that actually matter.

How it works:
1.	Configure AI – add your OpenAI token or connect to a local LM Studio API.
2.	Set preferences – explain the topics, tone, or types of posts you want to bookmark.
3.	Run the scan – let the extension review your feed and communities.

As it runs, XPostsFinder highlights and bookmarks the posts that fit your criteria. At any time, you can find the selected posts directly in your X bookmarks—ready to dive in without the endless scroll.
