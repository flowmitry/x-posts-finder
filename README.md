# X Posts Finder

X Posts Finder is a browser extension that helps you discover the posts worth engaging with on X (formerly Twitter). Describe what kinds of conversations you want to join, and the extension combs through your feed to surface the tweets that match.

## What It Does
- Highlights posts that align with the preferences you set in the popup
- Keeps track of how many tweets were reviewed and bookmarked while it runs
- Respects your existing bookmarks and avoids saving duplicates
- Stores your saved preferences so it is easy to restart a session later

## How to Use It
1. Open X.com in your browser and launch the extension.
2. Outline the topics or tone you want to focus on inside the popup.
3. Start the analysis and let the extension review your feed, bookmarking the best matches.
4. Stop the run at any time to see a quick summary of what it found.

Use it whenever you need a curated list of conversations to jump into without scrolling endlessly.
